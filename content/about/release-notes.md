Yoohoo it's here! After a lot of work we present you the totally renewed Pi4J library!

Most important info on V2:

* Java 11 and up
* Breaking change with V1 as the framework has been completely re-architected (see [pi4j.com/architecture](https://pi4j.com/architecture/))
* No longer include support for peripheral devices and add-on chipsets/boards as part of the core project
* Easier to extend, maintain and test
* Uses PiGpio as the native library (WiringPi which was used in V1 got deprecated in 2019)
* Builds as modules to fully support future evolutions in Java
* Uses minimal dependencies (only SLF4J)
* Different examples how to get started (also with JavaFX) are available on [pi4j.com/getting-started](https://pi4j.com/getting-started/)
* And more, see on [pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2](https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/)
