Follow these steps to get started quickly with this CrowPi OS.
Install the Raspberry Pi Imager The official Imager Tool can be downloaded directly from the Raspberry Pi website. This simple tool works on all common operating systems and can be installed very easily with just a few keystrokes.</description></item><item><title>Develop with Intellij IDEA</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/crowpi/develop-with-intellij/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/crowpi/develop-with-intellij/</guid><description>In this tutorial, IntelliJ IDEA is used for the development. The articles, instructions and pictures are created accordingly. IntelliJ IDEA is from available Jetbrains in different versions. The community version has enough functionality for development with the CrowPi and is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, but NOT for Raspberry Pi. The download can be found here.
The subsequent setup of IntelliJ IDEA is identical on all platforms.
Clone the repository As soon as we have installed the development environment, it is time to clone the entry-level project for the CrowPi.</description></item></channel></rss>
