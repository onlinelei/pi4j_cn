I²C (spoken as I-Squared-C) is a bus originally invented by Philips. It is designed as a classic master-slave bus. A data transfer is always i nitiated by a master. It can also be set up in a multi-master system. I²C is connected via two signal lines (data line and clock line). The transmission rate of the bus can be between 0.1 Mbit/s up to 3.4 Mbit/s depending on the clock rate.</description></item><item><title>I²C Clock Stretching</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/clock-stretching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/clock-stretching/</guid><description>Clock Stretching Please be aware there are some hardware issues when using the Raspberry Pi with devices that expect to be able to use clock stretching, for more info see &amp;ldquo;Adventures in I2C: clock stretching on the Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I2C stretch bug. Been fixed or not?&amp;quot;.
Clock stretching in I2C allows a slave device to halt the master before a more data is sent. This is often the case when the slave device writes to an EEPROM etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
